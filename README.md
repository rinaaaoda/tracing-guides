# トレース・ガイド(小田莉奈)

Live at http://rinaaaoda.github.io/tracing-guides/

This website is a community project to develop tracing guides for remote volunteers to add open geographic data to OpenStreetMap. Guides are an ordered collection of discrete mapping tips. Anyone can contribute!

If you'd like to contribute a tip or guide (we suggest starting with a tip), please submit a Pull Request
